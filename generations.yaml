    description: "The Renault Kwid is a subcompact crossover-styled hatchback primarily developed for emerging markets, first launched in India in 2015. Built on the CMF-A platform (Common Module Family - Affordable), the Kwid was designed to offer SUV-inspired styling in an ultra-affordable package. The car measures just under 3.7 meters in length but features relatively high ground clearance (180mm), plastic body cladding, and roof rails to create a crossover aesthetic that distinguishes it from traditional budget hatchbacks. Initially offered with a 0.8-liter three-cylinder engine producing 54 horsepower, the range later expanded to include a more powerful 1.0-liter option with 68 horsepower. Transmission options include a standard 5-speed manual and an automated manual transmission (Easy-R) introduced in 2016. The interior is surprisingly spacious for its segment and features a distinctive digital instrument cluster and, on higher trims, a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment systemâ€”unusual features for the ultra-budget segment when introduced. A significant facelift in 2019 brought revised styling with LED daytime running lights, reshaped bumpers, and interior refinements. Safety features were also enhanced to meet stricter regulations with the addition of driver airbag, ABS, and seatbelt reminders as standard across the range. The Kwid has been particularly successful in India, Brazil, and other emerging markets where its combination of affordable pricing, crossover styling, and reasonable equipment levels made it an attractive entry-level option. While not marketed in most European markets, the Kwid has been adapted for Europe as the Dacia Spring Electric, featuring the same basic design but with an electric powertrain and additional safety equipment to meet European standards."
